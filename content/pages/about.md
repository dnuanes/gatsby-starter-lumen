ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I am an email marketing professional dedicated to making email work for everyone.

I work across the email spectrum from the design/creative side to the strategic/technical side. Whether you want a custom coded email template in HTML/CSS or you need a complex, multi-month email marketing campaign built from scratch in the ESP of your choice, I can help.

I got my start in email working for Tulane University where I built out the email marketing program for the undergraduate recruitment team. This entailed coding custom templates, planning campaigns, writing copying, and everything else in between. After a few short years working on the undergraduate side, I moved up to a role overseeing email marketing for the 90+ graduate programs at Tulane. Nowadays, you can find me working at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business as the Email Marketing Manager overseeing email for our MBA programs. 

To compliment my official work, I've undertaken a number of freelance email gigs including developing email marketing for a local band, running newsletter marketing for a pet adoption agency, and developing email templates for a European shoe company.

When I'm not working, you can find me spending time with my girlfriend and dog, exploring the outdoors, cooking, and trying to eat the best food around.
