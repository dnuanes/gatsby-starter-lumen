ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I am an email marketing professional dedicated to making email work for everyone.

I work across the email marketing spectrum from the design/creative side to the strategic/technical side. Whether you want a custom coded email template in HTML/CSS or you need a complex, multi-month email marketing campaign built from scratch, I can help.

*This is me wearing a suit, something I mostly try to avoid.*
